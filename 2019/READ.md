AOC 2019: Participated through ING, with private leaderboard.

Due to delays in registrations, I entered the competition 3 days late.
I have no longer access to the leaderboard. All submissions in the repo were successful. I did not gain points for a few skipped assignments in the later stages of the 'championship'. I stopped submitting answers in the latter part of the 'championship' because it was no longer worth the time investment after it all ended.

Even with the 3 day delay I managed to end up in the top 20.

AOC 2019: Participated through ING, with private leaderboard.

Due to delays in registrations, I entered the competition 3 days late.
I have no longer access to the leaderboard. All submissions in the repo were successful. I did not gain points for a few skipped assignments in the later stages of the 'championship'. I stopped submitting answers in the latter part of the 'championship' because it was no longer worth the time investment after it all ended.

Even with the 3 day delay I managed to end up in the top 20.

There is a BREAKOUT game somewhere that needs the ncurses library for terminal screen control! ncurses is not included!
(By the way, we had to submit the final score after having finished the complete board. I solved this by letting the computer play the game. Rather than use Machine Learning, I use a simple trick, having the computer track the x-coordinate of the ball and taking into account reflection on a block or the wall.)

DISCLAIMER: Code provided AS IS! I will not fix discovered security issues! And given the time constraints of a competition, it's almost sure there will be security issues.
